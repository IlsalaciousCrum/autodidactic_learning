# Autodidactic Learning

This project is deployed at www.ilsagordon.com/hello

#### Goal

There are some topics from Hackbright Academy (covered in the second part of the program) that we didn't spend as much time on.

I learn best by doing and I love making things so as I go over these topics I will be implementing the ideas in fun and silly ways with this Flask app.

## Topics

* [Big O Notation flashcards](http://www.ilsagordon.com/runtime "Formatted for computer or mobile")
(Python, AJAX, Bootstrap, JQuery, Flask, Flask-Jinja)
