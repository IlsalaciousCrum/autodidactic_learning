# Autodidactic Learning

This project is deployed at www.ilsagordon.com/hello

#### Goal

There are some topics from Hackbright Academy (covered in the second part of the program) that we didn't spend as much time on.

I learn best by doing and I love making things so as I go over these topics I will be implementing the ideas in fun and silly ways with this Flask app.

There may not be much front-end development at first because familiarity with python topics is the goal.
